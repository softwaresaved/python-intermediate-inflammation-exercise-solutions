# Introduction

This repository contains exercise solutions for the [Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development) course. The course itself is using the [template software project repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-inflammation) which each participant copy and work on during the course as part of exercises. 

This repository is a copy of the [template software project repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-inflammation) with all the course's exercises filled in with reference solutions - each tag on this repository represents the state that the software project should be at the end of a particular episode.

Note that, while the course recommends working on the development and various other feature branches during exercises, this repository contains only a single branch (`main`) and 
tags to point to the state of the code that the software project should be at the end of the each episode of the course.
